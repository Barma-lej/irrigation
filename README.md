Upgrade and automate my existing garden irrigation

What i had to 2015 year:
1. Plumbing with water tap
2. One pipeline with 3 [Gardena Pop-up Oscillating Sprinkler R 140 (1537-29)](https://www.gardena.com/int/products/watering/sprinklersystem/pop-up-oscillating-sprinkler-r-140/900933201/))

Then in 2015 year i change [Gardena Pop-up Oscillating Sprinkler R 140 (1537-29)](https://www.gardena.com/int/products/watering/sprinklersystem/pop-up-oscillating-sprinkler-r-140/900933201/) to [Gardena Pop-Up Oscillating Sprinkler OS 140 (8220-29)](https://www.gardena.com/int/products/watering/sprinklersystem/pop-up-oscillating-sprinkler-os-140/967170901/).

Yes, I didnâ€™t think that my pressure would be not enough! Now I had to close one tap every time.

Now it is time to change everything :)
